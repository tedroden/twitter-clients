# Twitter Clients

Since most of the twitter apps I've seen aren't that great, I was curious to see what people were using. (Hint: the website).

You can try it out here [twitter-clients.appspot.com](https://twitter-clients.appspot.com)

## what is it?

This is a simple app that will:

 1. Let you authenticate via twitter
 2. Load tweets from your timeline
 3. Show you the most popular twitter clients
